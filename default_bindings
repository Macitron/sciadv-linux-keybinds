For quick reference, these are the default keybindings for CHAOS;HEAD NOAH.
If different games end up having wildly different bindings, I will eventually turn this file into proper Markdown with sections for each.

f1 = Help
f2 = Backlog
f3 = Auto mode
f4 = Tips
f5 = Load
f6 = Save
f7 = Quick Load
f8 = Quick Save
f9 = Config
f10 = Title Menu
f11 = Fullscreen
f12 = Screenshot
Insert = Backlog
Delete = Auto mode
1 = System menu
Backspace = Back / Hide text
Q = Force skip / Page left
E = Skip / Page right
[,] = Text scroll (tips, backlog)
\ = Resolution
Enter = Enter lul
Z,C = Delusion trigger
Ctrl = Force skip (/ page left? for real?)
Arrow keys = Select (menu, messages)
